Python project for the first and second semester of 2022.

this project consists of code written using the object oriented programming paradigm.
oop means that the program is built based on objects. A class is created and then methods. 
the methods represent the functionality of the objects.

an example of a class in Python:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
      self.fname = fname
      self.lname = lname
      
person = Person()


Then, there functional python, where functions are created to make programs run easier and more smooth.

there are many python functions stright out of the box, and there are user-made functions.

an example of a user made function that returns a number multiplied:

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
    
print(multiply(10, 20))

this should return 30.
